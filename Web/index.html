        <blockquote> Team of astronomers<del>, including 
        researchers at MIT,</del> has picked up 
        on a curious, repeating rhythm of 
        fast radio bursts emanating from an 
        unknown source outside our galaxy, 
        500 million light years away.</blockquote>

        <blockquote><dfn>Fast radio bursts</dfn><ins>, or 
        FRBs,</ins> are short, intense 
        flashes of radio waves that are thought to be the 
        product of small, distant, extremely dense objects, 
        though exactly what those objects might be is a 
        longstanding mystery in astrophysics. <abbr title="Fast radio bursts">FRBs</abbr>s typically 
        last a few milliseconds, during which time they can 
        outshine entire galaxies.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Since the first <abbr title="Fast radio bursts">FRBs</abbr> was observed in 2007, astronomers 
        have catalogued over <mark>100</mark> fast radio bursts from 
        distant sources scattered across the universe, 
        outside our own galaxy. For the most part, these 
        detections were one-offs, flashing briefly before 
        disappearing entirely. In a handful of instances, 
        astronomers observed fast radio bursts multiple 
        times from the same source, though with no 
        discernible pattern.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>This new <abbr title="Fast radio bursts">FRBs</abbr> source, which the team has catalogued 
        as <abbr title="Fast radio bursts">FRBs</abbr> <var>180916.J0158+65</var> , is the first to produce a 
        periodic, or cyclical pattern of fast radio bursts. 
        The pattern begins with a noisy, four-day window, 
        during which the source emits random bursts of 
        radio waves, followed by a 12-day period of radio 
        silence.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>The astronomers observed that this 16-day pattern 
        of fast radio bursts reoccurred consistently over 
        500 days of observations. "This <abbr title="Fast radio bursts">FRBs</abbr> we're reporting 
        now is like clockwork," says Kiyoshi Masui, assistant
        professor of physics in MIT's Kavli Institute for 
        Astrophysics and Space Research. "It's the most 
        definitive pattern we've seen from one of these 
        sources. And it's a big clue that we can use to 
        start hunting down the physics of what's causing 
        these bright flashes, which nobody really 
        understands."</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Masui is a member of the <abbr title="Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping 
        Experiment">CHIME</abbr> /FRB collaboration, 
        a group of more than 50 scientists led by the 
        University of British Columbia, McGill University, 
        University of Toronto, and the National Research 
        Council of Canada, that operates and analyzes the 
        data from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping 
        Experiment, or CHIME, a radio telescope in British 
        Columbia that was the first to pick up signals of 
        the new periodic <abbr title="Fast radio bursts">FRBs</abbr> source.</blockquote>
